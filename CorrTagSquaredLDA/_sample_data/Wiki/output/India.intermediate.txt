Stone Age rock shelters with paintings at the [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]] are the earliest known traces of human life in India. The first known permanent settlements appeared about 8,500 years ago and gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]],<ref>{{cite web |title = Introduction to the Ancient Indus Valley |url=http://www.harappa.com/indus/indus1.html
|accessdate = 18 June 2007 |year= 1996 |publisher = Harappa}}</ref> dating back to 3400&nbsp;[[Common Era|BCE]] in western India. It was followed by the [[Vedic period]], which laid the foundations of [[Hinduism]] and other cultural aspects of early Indian society, and ended in the 500s BCE. From around 550&nbsp;BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the [[Mahajanapadas]] were established across the country.<ref>{{cite book | author= Krishna Reddy | title = Indian History | year= 2003 | publisher = Tata McGraw Hill | location = New Delhi | isbn = 0070483698 | page = A107}}</ref>

In the 3rd century&nbsp;BCE, most of South Asia was united into the [[Maurya Empire]] by [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and flourished under [[Ashoka the Great]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Maurya dynasty |url = http://www.livius.org/man-md/mauryas/mauryas.html |author = Jona Lendering |accessdate = 17 June 2007}}</ref> From the 3rd century CE, the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta dynasty]] oversaw the period referred to as ancient "[[Golden Age of India|India's Golden Age]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/ancient_history4.php|title=Gupta period has been described as the Golden Age of Indian history|accessdate=3 October 2007 |publisher= ''[[National Informatics Centre]] (NIC)''}}</ref><ref>Heitzman, James.

Following [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Islamic invasions from Central Asia]] between the 10th and 12th centuries, much of northern India came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later the [[Mughal Empire]]. Under the rule of [[Akbar the Great]], India enjoyed much cultural and economic progress as well as religious harmony.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edwebproject.org/india/mughals.html|title=The Mughal Legacy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.easternbookcorporation.com/moreinfo.php?txt_searchstring=13880|title=The Mughal World : Life in India's Last Golden Age}}</ref> Mughal emperors gradually expanded their empires to cover large parts of the subcontinent. However, in [[North-East India|northeastern India]], the dominant power was the [[Ahom kingdom]] of [[Assam]], among the few kingdoms to have resisted Mughal subjugation. The first major threat to Mughal imperial power came from a [[Hindu]] [[Rajput]] king [[Maha Rana Pratap]] of [[Mewar]] in the 16th century. By early 1700s, the [[Sikh Empire]] and the [[Maratha]]s had emerged as formidable foes of the Mughals.<ref>{{cite book

From the 16th century, European powers such as Portugal, the Netherlands, Denmark, France, and Great Britain established trading posts and later took advantage of internal conflicts to [[colonial India|establish colonies in the country]]. By 1856, most of India was [[Company rule in India|under the control]] of the [[Honourable East India Company|British East India Company]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/history_freedom_struggle.php|title=History : Indian Freedom Struggle (1857–1947)|accessdate=3 October 2007 |publisher= National Informatics Centre (NIC) |quote=And by 1856, the British conquest and its authority were firmly established.}}</ref> A year later, a nationwide insurrection of rebelling military units and kingdoms, known as [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|India's First War of Independence]] or the ''Sepoy Mutiny'', seriously challenged the Company's control but eventually failed. As a result of the instability, India was brought [[British Raj|under the direct rule]] of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Crown]].

Within Indian [[political culture]], the INC is considered centre-left or "liberal" and the BJP is considered centre-right or "conservative". The INC was out of power between 1977 and 1980, when the [[Janata Party]] won the election owing to public discontent with the [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]] declared by the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]].

The years 1996–1998 were a period of turmoil in the federal government with several short-lived alliances holding sway.
