==History==
{{Main|History of Brazil}}

===Etymology===
{{Main|Name of Brazil}}
The [[etymology]] of Brazil remains unclear. Traditionally, the word "Brazil" comes from the [[brazilwood]], a timber tree which many sailors traded from Brazilian regions to [[Europe]] in the 16th century.<ref name="BuenoTrintaSeis">{{Pt}} Eduardo Bueno, ''Brasil: uma História'' (São Paulo: Ática, 2003; ISBN 8508082134), p.36.</ref> In Portuguese brazilwood is called ''pau-brasil'', with the word ''brasil'' commonly given the etymology "red like an ember", formed from [[Latin]] ''brasa'' ("ember") and the suffix ''-il'' (from ''-iculum'' or ''-ilium'').<ref>[http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/brésil CNRTL] - Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales {{fr}}</ref><ref>[http://michaelis.uol.com.br/moderno/portugues/index.php?lingua=portugues-portugues&palavra=brasil Michaelis] - Moderno Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa {{pt}}</ref><ref>[http://aulete.uol.com.br/site.php?mdl=aulete_digital&op=loadVerbete&pesquisa=1&palavra=brasil iDicionário Aulete] {{pt}}</ref> This theory is taught as official in schools of Brazil and [[Portugal]], but some{{who|date=November 2010}} Brazilian scholars have postulated that the word is older, being found in the language of ancient [[Phoenicians]] though some think it has [[Celts|Celtic]] origins.<ref>{{Pt}} "[http://www.enciclopedia.com.pt/articles.php?article_id=486 República Federativa do Brasil]". Consulted on October 9, 2010.</ref> These people kept the trade of a red dye extracted from a mineral which operated mines in [[Iberia]] to [[Ireland]]. In fact, the [[Irish mythology|legendary Irish]] island of [[Hy-Brazil]] is seen by some{{who|date=November 2010}} (and was also to 16th century scholars) as one of the most likely etymological sources for "Brazil".<ref name="BuenoTrintaSeis" /> In the [[Guarani language]], an official language of [[Paraguay]], Brazil is called "[[Pindorama]]" — it was the name the [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|natives]] gave to the region, meaning "land of the palm trees."

===Portuguese colonization and territorial expansion===
{{Main|Colonial Brazil}}
{{See also|Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Slavery in Brazil}}
The land now called Brazil was claimed by Portugal in April 1500, on the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]].<ref name="Boxer, p. 98">Boxer, p.&nbsp;98.</ref> The Portuguese encountered [[Stone Age|stone age]] natives divided into several tribes, most of whom shared the same [[Tupi-Guarani]] linguistic family, and fought among themselves.<ref name="Boxer, p.&nbsp;100">Boxer, p. 100.</ref>

Colonization was effectively begun in 1534—though the first settlement was founded in 1532—, when [[Don (honorific)|Dom]] [[John III of Portugal|João III]] divided the territory into twelve hereditary captaincies,<ref>Boxer, pp.&nbsp;100–101.</ref><ref name="Skidmore, p.&nbsp;27">Skidmore, p.&nbsp;27.</ref> but this arrangement proved problematic and in 1549 the king assigned a [[Governor-General]] to administer the entire colony.<ref name="Skidmore, p.&nbsp;27"/><ref>Boxer, p.&nbsp;101.</ref> The Portuguese assimilated some of the native tribes<ref>Boxer, p.&nbsp;108</ref> while others were enslaved or exterminated in long wars or by European diseases to which they had no immunity.<ref name="Boxer, p.&nbsp;102">Boxer, p.&nbsp;102.</ref><ref>Skidmore, pp.&nbsp;30, 32.</ref> By the mid-16th century, sugar had become Brazil's most important export<ref name="Boxer, p.&nbsp;100"/><ref>Skidmore, p.&nbsp;36.</ref> and the Portuguese imported African slaves<ref>Boxer, p.&nbsp;110</ref><ref>Skidmore, p.&nbsp;34.</ref> to cope with the increasing international [[demand (economics)|demand]].<ref name="Boxer, p.&nbsp;102"/><ref>Skidmore, pp.&nbsp;32–33.</ref>
[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|left|The first Christian mass in Brazil, 1500.]]
Through wars against the French, the Portuguese slowly expanded their territory to the southeast, taking [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1567, and to the northwest, taking [[São Luís, Maranhão|São Luís]] in 1615.<ref>Bueno, pp.&nbsp;80–81.</ref> They sent military expeditions to the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon rainforest]] and conquered British and Dutch strongholds,<ref>[http://www.s4ulanguages.com/wic.html Facsimiles of multiple original documents] relating about the events in Brazil in the 17th century that led to a Dutch influence and their final defeat</ref> founding villages and forts from 1669.<ref>Calmon, p.&nbsp;294.</ref> In 1680 they reached the far south and founded [[Colonia del Sacramento|Sacramento]] on the bank of the [[Río de la Plata|Rio de la Plata]], in the Eastern Strip region (present-day [[Uruguay]]).<ref>Bueno, p.&nbsp;86.</ref>

At the end of the 17th century, sugar exports started to decline<ref>Boxer, p.&nbsp;164.</ref> but beginning in the 1690s, the discovery of gold by [[Bandeirantes|explorers]] in the region that would later be called [[Minas Gerais]] (General Mines) in current [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Goiás]], saved the colony from imminent collapse.<ref>Boxer, pp.&nbsp;168, 170.</ref> From all over Brazil, as well as from Portugal, thousands of immigrants came to the mines.<ref>Boxer, p.&nbsp;169.</ref>

The Spanish tried to prevent Portuguese expansion into the territory that belonged to them according to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|1494 Treaty of Tordesillas]], and succeeded in conquering the [[Banda Oriental|Eastern Strip]] in 1777. However, this was in vain as the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]], signed in the same year, confirmed Portuguese sovereignty over all lands proceeding from its territorial expansion, thus creating most of the current Brazilian borders.<ref>Boxer, p.&nbsp;207.</ref>

In 1808, the Portuguese royal family, fleeing the troops of the French Emperor [[Napoleon I]] that were invading Portugal and most of Central Europe, [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|established themselves]] in the city of Rio de Janeiro, which thus became the seat of the entire [[Portuguese Empire]].<ref name="Boxer, p.&nbsp;213">Boxer, p.&nbsp;213.</ref> In 1815 [[John VI of Portugal|Dom João VI]], then regent on behalf of his incapacitated mother, elevated Brazil from colony to sovereign [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Kingdom united with Portugal]].<ref name="Boxer, p.&nbsp;213"/> In 1809 the Portuguese invaded [[French Guiana]] (which was returned to France in 1817)<ref>Bueno, p.&nbsp;145.</ref> and in 1816 the Eastern Strip, subsequently renamed [[Cisplatina]]<ref>Calmon (2002), p.&nbsp;191.</ref> (but Brazil [[Argentina-Brazil War|lost it in 1828]] when it became an independent nation known as [[Uruguay]]).<ref>Barman (1999), pp.18, 27</ref>

===Independence and empire===
{{Main|Brazilian Independence|Empire of Brazil}}
King [[John VI of Portugal|João VI]] returned to Europe on 26 April 1821, leaving his elder son Prince [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro de Alcântara]] as regent to rule Brazil.<ref>Lustosa, pp.&nbsp;109–110</ref> The Portuguese government attempted to turn Brazil into a colony once again, thus depriving it of its achievements since 1808.<ref>Lustosa, pp.&nbsp;117–119</ref> The Brazilians refused to yield and Prince Pedro stood by them declaring the country's independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822.<ref>Lustosa, pp.&nbsp;150–153</ref> On 12 October 1822, Pedro was declared the first Emperor of Brazil and crowned [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro I]] on 1 December 1822.<ref>Vianna, p.&nbsp;418</ref>
[[File:Independência ou Morte.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Declaration of the [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|Brazilian independence]] by Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] on 7 September 1822.]]

At that time almost all Brazilians were in favor of a monarchy and [[republicanism]] had little support.<ref>Hendrik Kraay ''apud'' Lorenzo Aldé, ''Revista de História da Biblioteca Nacional,'' issue 50, year 5 (Rio de Janeiro: SABIN, 2009), p.&nbsp;20</ref><ref>Sérgio Buarque de Holanda, ''O Brasil Monárquico: o processo de emancipação'', 4th ed.

The first Brazilian constitution was promulgated on 25 March 1824, after its acceptance by the municipal councils across the country.<ref>Vianna, p.&nbsp;140</ref><ref>José Murilo de Carvalho, ''A Monarquia brasileira'' (Rio de Janeiro: Ao Livro Técnico, 1993), p.&nbsp;23</ref><ref>Calmon (2002), p.&nbsp;189</ref><ref name="Vainfas, p.&nbsp;170">Vainfas, p.&nbsp;170</ref> Pedro I abdicated on 7 April 1831 and went to Europe to [[Liberal Wars|reclaim his daughter’s crown]], leaving behind his five year old son and heir, who was to become [[Pedro II of Brazil|Dom Pedro II]].<ref>Lyra (v.1), p.&nbsp;17</ref> As the new emperor could not exert his constitutional prerogatives until he reached maturity, a [[regent|regency]] was created.<ref>Carvalho 2007, p.&nbsp;21</ref>

Disputes between political factions led to rebellions and an unstable, almost anarchical, regency.<ref>Miriam Dohlnikoff, ''Pacto imperial: origens do federalismo no Brasil do século XIX'' (São Paulo: Globo, 2005), p.&nbsp;206</ref> The rebellious factions, however, were not in revolt against the monarchy,<ref name="Carvalho 2007, p.&nbsp;43">Carvalho (2007), p.&nbsp;43</ref><ref>Souza, p.&nbsp;326</ref> even though some declared the secession of the provinces as independent republics, but only so long as Pedro II was a minor.<ref>Janotti, pp.&nbsp;171–172</ref> Because of this, Pedro II was prematurely declared of age and "Brazil was to enjoy nearly half a century of internal peace and rapid material progress."<ref>Munro, p.&nbsp;273</ref>
[[File:Americo-avaí.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Brazilian forces (in blue uniform) engage the Paraguayan army (some in red uniform and other shirtless) during the [[War of the Triple Alliance]].]]

Brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of Pedro II (the [[Platine War]], the [[Uruguayan War]] and the [[War of the Triple Alliance]])<ref>Lyra (v.1), pp.&nbsp;164, 225, 272</ref> and witnessed the consolidation of [[representative democracy]], mainly due to successive [[election]]s and unrestricted [[freedom of the press]].<ref>Carvalho (2007), pp.&nbsp;9, 222</ref> Most importantly, slavery was extinguished after a slow but steady process that began with the end of the international traffic in slaves in 1850<ref>Lyra (v.1), p.&nbsp;166</ref> and ended with the complete abolition of slavery in 1888.<ref>Lyra (v.3), p.&nbsp;62</ref> The slave population had been in decline since Brazil's independence: in 1823, 29% of the Brazilian population were slaves but by 1887 this had fallen to 5%.<ref>Vainfas, p.&nbsp;18</ref>

When the monarchy was overthrown on 15 November 1889<ref name="Munro, p.&nbsp;280"/> there was little desire in Brazil to change the [[form of government]]<ref>George Ermakoff, ''Rio de Janeiro – 1840–1900 – Uma crônica fotográfica'' (Rio de Janeiro: G. Ermakoff Casa Editorial, 2006), p.&nbsp;189</ref> and Pedro II was at the height of his popularity among his subjects.<ref>Schwarcz, p.&nbsp;444</ref><ref>Vainfas, p.&nbsp;201</ref> However, he "bore prime, perhaps sole, responsibility for his own overthrow."<ref>Barman (1999), p.&nbsp;399</ref> After the death of his two sons, Pedro believed that "the imperial regime was destined to end with him."<ref>Barman (1999), p.&nbsp;130</ref> He cared little for the regime's fate<ref>Lyra (v.3), p.&nbsp;126</ref><ref>Barman (1999), p.&nbsp;361</ref> and so neither did anything, nor allowed anyone else to do anything, to prevent the military coup, backed by former slave owners who resented the abolition of slavery.<ref>Ricardo Salles, ''Nostalgia Imperial'' (Rio de Janeiro: Topbooks, 1996), p.&nbsp;194 – However, the monarchist reaction after the fall of the empire and the subsequent exile of the Imperial Family "was not small and even less was its repression".</ref><ref>Lyra (v.3), p.&nbsp;99</ref><ref>Schwarcz, pp.&nbsp;450, 457</ref>

[[File:Revolução de 1930.jpg|thumb|The Brazilian coup d'état of 1930 raised [[Getúlio Vargas]] (center with military uniform but no hat) to power. He would rule the country [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|for fifteen years]].]]

The "early republican government was little more than a military dictatorship. The army dominated affairs both at Rio de Janeiro and in the states. Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power".<ref name="Munro, p.&nbsp;280">Munro, p.&nbsp;280</ref> In 1894 the republican civilians rose to power, opening a "prolonged cycle of civil war, financial disaster, and government incompetence."<ref name="Barman 1999, p.&nbsp;403">Barman (1999), p.&nbsp;403</ref> By 1902, the government began a return to the policies pursued during the Empire, policies that promised peace and order at home and a restoration of Brazil's prestige abroad.<ref name="Barman 1999, p.&nbsp;403"/> and was successful in negotiating several treaties that expanded (with the purchase of [[Acre (state)|Acre]]) and secured the Brazilian boundaries.<ref>Barman (1999), p.&nbsp;404</ref>

Several brief interim governments succeeded after Vargas's suicide.<ref>Skidmore, p.&nbsp;201</ref> [[Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira|Juscelino Kubitscheck]] became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises.<ref>Skidmore, pp.&nbsp;202–203</ref> The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably,<ref>Skidmore, p.&nbsp;204</ref> but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of [[Brasília]], inaugurated in 1960.<ref>Skidmore, pp.&nbsp;204–205</ref> His successor was [[Jânio Quadros]], who resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office.<ref>Skidmore, pp.&nbsp;209–210</ref> His vice-president, [[João Goulart]], assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition<ref>Skidmore, p.&nbsp;210</ref> and was [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|deposed in April 1964 by a coup]] that resulted in a [[Brazilian military government|military regime]].<ref>Fausto (2005), p.&nbsp;397</ref>

The new regime was intended to be transitory<ref>Gaspari, ''A Ditadura Envergonhada'', pp.&nbsp;141–142.</ref> but it gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the Fifth Institutional Act in 1968.<ref name="Gaspari p.35">Gaspari, ''A Ditadura Envergonhada'', p.&nbsp;35.</ref> The repression of the dictatorship's opponents, including urban guerrillas,<ref>Elio Gaspari, ''A ditadura escancarada'' (São Paulo: Companhia das Letras, 2002), p.&nbsp;193.</ref> was harsh, but not as brutal as in other Latin American countries.<ref>Skidmore, p.&nbsp;239</ref> Due to the extraordinary economic growth, known as an "economic miracle", the regime reached its highest level of popularity in the years of repression.<ref>Fausto (2005), p.&nbsp;422</ref>

General [[Ernesto Geisel]] became president in 1974 and began his project of re-democratization through a process that he said would be "slow, gradual and safe."<ref>Bueno, p.&nbsp;379.</ref><ref>Fausto (2005), p.&nbsp;455.</ref> Geisel ended the military indiscipline that had plagued the country since 1889,<ref>Gaspari, ''A Ditadura Envergonhada'', pp.&nbsp;34–35.</ref> as well as the torture of political prisoners, censorship of the press,<ref>Gaspari, ''A Ditadura Envergonhada'', pp.&nbsp;35–36.</ref> and finally, the dictatorship itself, after he extinguished the Fifth Institutional Act.<ref name="Gaspari p.35"/> However, the military regime continued, under his chosen successor General [[João Baptista de Oliveira Figueiredo|João Figueiredo]], to complete the transition to full democracy.<ref>Bueno, p.&nbsp;382.</ref>

The civilians fully returned to power in 1985 when [[José Sarney]] assumed the presidency<ref>Fausto (2005), p.&nbsp;460.</ref> but, by the end of his term, he had become extremely unpopular due to the uncontrollable economic crisis and unusually high inflation.<ref>Fausto (2005), pp.&nbsp;464–465.</ref> Sarney's unsuccessful government allowed the election in 1989 of the almost unknown [[Fernando Collor de Mello|Fernando Collor]], who was subsequently impeached by the National Congress in 1992.<ref>Fausto (2005), pp.&nbsp;465, 475.</ref> Collor was succeeded by his Vice-President [[Itamar Franco]], who appointed [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] as Minister of Finance.

Cardoso produced a highly successful [[Plano Real]] (Royal or Real Plan)<ref>The name of the current Brazilian currency came both from the Real Unity of Value (a transition currency) and from an [[Brazilian real#First real, 1690-1942|older currency that existed until 1942]].

The Brazilian Federation is the "indissoluble union" of three distinct political entities: the States, the Municipalities and the Federal District.<ref name="Constituição"/> The Union, the states and the Federal District, and the municipalities, are the "spheres of government". The Federation is set on five fundamental principles:<ref name="Constituição"/> [[sovereignty]], [[citizenship]], [[dignity]] of human beings, the social values of labour and freedom of enterprise, and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]]. The classic tripartite branches of government ([[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature|legislative]], and [[judiciary|judicial]] under the [[Separation of powers|checks and balances]] system), is formally established by the Constitution.<ref name="Constituição"/> The executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government, while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state/Federal District spheres.

All members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected.<ref name=embassy>{{cite web |url=http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/brazil_in_brief/political_institution.html |title=Embassy of Brazil&nbsp;— Ottawa |date= |quote=Political Institutions&nbsp;— The Executive |accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citymayors.com/government/brazil_government.html |title=City Mayors |date= |quote=Brazil federal, state and local government |accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0024-7413(196424)1%3A2%3C29%3ABP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-W |title=JSTOR |date= |quote=Brazilian Politics |accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref> Judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams.<ref name=embassy/> Brazil has a [[multi-party system]] for most of its history. Voting is compulsory for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70.<ref name="Constituição"/> Together with several smaller parties, four political parties stand out: [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (PT), [[Brazilian Social Democratic Party|Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB), [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (PMDB), and [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]] (DEM). Almost all governmental and administrative functions are exercised by authorities and agencies affiliated to the Executive.

The form of government is that of a [[democracy|democratic]] republic, with a [[presidential system]].<ref name="Constituição"/> The president is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] of the Union and is [[elected]] for a four-year term,<ref name="Constituição"/> with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term. The current president is [[Dilma Rousseff]] who was inaugurated on January 1, 2011.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2367025.stm "Leftist Lula wins Brazil election"] BBC News. Accessed 17 May 2007</ref>  The President appoints the [[Minister of State|Ministers of State]], who assist in government.<ref name="Constituição"/> Legislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in Brazil. The [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] is the Federation's bicameral legislature, consisting of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]]. Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively.

Fifteen political parties are represented in Congress. It is common for politicians to switch parties, and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly. The largest political parties are the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (PT), Democrats (DEM), Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB-center), [[Brazilian Social Democratic Party]] (PSDB), Progressive Party (PP), Brazilian Labor Party (PTB), Liberal Party (PL), Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB), Popular Socialist Party (PPS), Democratic Labor Party (PDT), and the Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southtravels.com/america/brazil/government.html |title=Government – Brazil |publisher=Southtravels.com |date=1988-10-05 |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>

===Law===
{{Main|Law of Brazil|Crime in Brazil}}
[[File:Supreme Federal Court of Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Supreme Federal Tribunal]].]]
Brazilian law is based on [[Roman law|Roman]]-[[Germania|Germanic]] traditions<ref>[http://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/en/bra/en_bra-int-des-ordrjur.html "The Brazilian Legal System"], Organization of American States. Accessed 17 May 2007.</ref> and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] concepts prevail over common law practice. Most of Brazilian law is codified, although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines; however, they are seldom binding on other specific cases. Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases.

The legal system is based on the Federal Constitution, which was promulgated on 5 October 1988, and is the fundamental law of Brazil. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules.<ref>José Afonso da Silva, ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo'' (Malheiros, 2004; ISBN 85-7420-559-1), p.&nbsp; 46.</ref> As of April 2007, there have been 53 amendments. States have their own constitutions, which must not contradict the Federal Constitution.<ref>Silva, ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo'', p.&nbsp; 592.</ref> Municipalities and the Federal District have "organic laws" ({{lang|pt|''leis orgânicas''}}) which act in a similar way to constitutions.<ref name="Constituição"/><ref>[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/government_structure/loren/ "Government structure"]{{dead link|date=October 2010}} Brazilian Government. Accessed 17 May 2007.</ref> Legislative entities are the main source of [[statute]]s, although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms.<ref name="Constituição"/> Jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare situations the [[Constitution of Brazil|Federal Constitution]] allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments.<ref name="Constituição"/> There are also specialized military, labor, and electoral courts.<ref name="Constituição"/> The highest court is the [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Supreme Federal Tribunal]].

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|States of Brazil|Municipalities of Brazil}}
{{See also|Regions of Brazil}}
{| class="infobox"
|{{Brazil Labelled Map}}
|}

Brazil is a federation composed of twenty-six [[Federated state|States]], one [[Brazilian Federal District|federal district]] (which contains the capital city, [[Brasília]]) and municipalities.<ref name="Constituição"/> States have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government. They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters. They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice. Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in the [[United States]]. For example, criminal and civil laws can only be voted by the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country.<ref name="Constituição"/>

The states and the federal district may be grouped into regions: [[Northern Region, Brazil|Northern]], [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West]], [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] and [[Southern Region, Brazil|Southern]]. The Brazilian regions are merely geographical, not political or administrative divisions, and they do not have any specific form of government. Although defined by law, Brazilian regions are useful mainly for statistical purposes, and also to define the application of federal funds in development projects.

Municipalities, as the states, have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Union and state government.<ref name="Constituição"/> Each has a mayor and an elected legislative body, but no separate Court of Law. Indeed, a Court of Law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called ''[[comarca]]'' (county).
